    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        <span id="name">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</span>was an Indian scientist who served as the 11th President of India from
        2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He
        spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
        Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
        space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for
        his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational,
        technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test
        by India in 1974.</p>
      <p>
        Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
        then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President", he returned to his civilian
        life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards,
        including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
